        <h3>What does Cale do?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="content-container">
        <p>
            Cale specializes in helping students plan and create outstanding applications for college admissions and
            scholarships. He saves families time and money while teaching his students life-long skills that
            matter.
        </p>
        <p>
            Students and parents always have a million things going on when senior year hits, but the window of
            opportunity is only a few short months long. If you don't know exactly what to do and how to do it you are
            leaving money on the table. There is so much clutter on the internet that it makes it very hard to know what
            is worth your time and even harder to know the best way to do it. But if you miss either one of these points
            you are foregoing opportunity, especially with scholarships.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cale removes the clutter and gives his students precise step-by-step instruction. Specifically, he provides
            unprecedented value during essay planning and letters of recommendation. Most students write their essays
            around shallow, generic ideas and Cale knows how to draw out inspiring, deep ideas from his students. Even
            if you have the best stories, it takes +10 hours of revising and editing to turn them into incredible
            essays. Starting every essay with the right ideas is essential.

        <h3>Why does Cale do what he does?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="content-container">
        <p>
            Working with students to optimize their applications is the greatest vessel to teach critical life and
            technical skills that Cale's students take with them for the rest of their lives. In school the primary
            external
            motivator is GPA; that vessel often isn't strong enough to motivate learning something. You can have a unit
            in school on how to
            write a resume or write a persuasive essay. But when the stakes are high and an outstanding applications are
            what
            stands between getting into Harvard, graduating debt free, or getting a job offer at Google, the situation
            changes. Students now want to write the best resume, the essay, and have the best interview.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cale loves working with students during these high stakes times because it gives him the opportunity to
            change a
            student's beliefs about what is possible about themselves. To him it isn't only about getting accepted,
            getting the offer, or earning the scholarship. Even with the best applications it comes down to luck in the
            end. Cale loves the work he does because he can bring out persistance, optimism, confidence, and good
            ethics. Cale loves
            the work he does because when the pressure is on he can help turn his students into the best versions of
            themselves. Hearing the news when a student receives a $10,000 scholarship, was accepted to their target
            university, or got that job offer is incredible. But the skills learned and mastered from working with Cale
            never go away. Concise and persuasive writing, managing deadlines, leveraging your strengths and outsourcing
            weaknesses in a team setting, strategic thinking and decision making. These skills will be used over and
            over in students professional lives and the sooner they master them, the more opportunities they will be
            exposed to.

    <div class="title-container">
        <h3>Why is Cale the best?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="content-container">
        <p>
            Experience, relatability, and passion.
        </p>
        <p>
            During highschool and throughout college, Cale refined a proven system for how to crush applications and
            interviews. He used his skills to graduate debt free for the University of Wisconsin-Madison and receive
            multiple job
            offers from companies like Amazon AWS. He has helped hundreds of
            students and their parents with college, scholarship, graduate, and job applications in one-on-one and group
            settings. In addition to working directly with students and their parents, Cale has conducted over 50
            in-depth interviews with scholarship evaluators, scholarship coordinators, and admissions consultants to
            learn what goes on behind the scenes in many admission processes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Forming trust and a relationship with each student Cale works with is essential. Crushing the application
            process involves finding the right applications, picking the right ideas to present, and communicating those
            ideas in the best way. Picking the right ideas is the hardest component and it is his responsibility to draw
            out
            those ideas and put them to action. Cale is phenomenal at this because his range of experiences allows him
            to
            better understand his students passions and push them further. Cale has been passionately involved in: Cross
            Country, Track, Basketball, Volleyball, Tennis, Wakeboarding, Snowboarding, Skateboarding, Soccer,
            Gymnastics,
            Robotics, Computer Science, Marketing, Education, Entrepreneurship, Music Production, Painting, Investments,
            Health Care, Mechanical Engineering, Toy Inventing, Physics, Math, Community Service, Writing,
            Sustainability,
            Fishing, Sales and Triathlons. Cale believes that every dream, hobby, culture, belief, job, and subject is
            amazing if you take the time and energy to understand it. His mindset and breath of experiences is why he is
            incredibly relatable and effective at helping his students pick and develop their best ideas.
